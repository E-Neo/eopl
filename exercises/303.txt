1. Addition can be represented by substraction, i.e. +(a, b) = -(a, -(0, b))
2. Substraction opration can also be used to represent minus operation, i.e.
   minus(x) = -(0, x) while it is not easy to represent minus opertaion using
   addition operation.
3. Substraction is sensitive to the order of evaluation while addition is not.
   So we can have a better understanding by choosing substraction as our only
   arithmetic operation.
